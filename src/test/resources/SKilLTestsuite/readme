Folders below contain skill files which are meant to serve as a test suit for language bindings.
These tests are mostly taken from the language specification.

There are three categories:

1. working: These files are legal binary skill files and should be readable by most generated code. (The only reason for failure is the presence of a type declaration that is not compatible with one found inside the .sf-file)

2. maybe: These files are broken, but contain errors that wont be detected by a lazy evaluation of the file.

3. broken: Illegal files, which are intentionally broken. These serve as a detector for bugs in generated bindings.
