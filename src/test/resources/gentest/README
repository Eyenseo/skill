this folder contains generic tests.
tests are created using the command line interface and its arguments.
if the frist line is of the form '#!' <id>, then the <id> is used as package name and a respective test is generated.
this feature can be used to create skill specifications that should not be used as tests directly.

tests will be created for all .skill-files and all known generator implementations.
output directory will be testsuites/<language name>
